### Up and running
Most writing on the interweb is about getting started. I dont know how many millions of pages there are describing how to say "hello" to the world. Getting up and running is great, but then what?

When I learned to program, the internet didn't really exist. I had to learn from a few books and trial and error.  I stopped buying books on programming when I realised that the majority of them were re-hashed versions of the online documentation, it seems to me that those with knowledge have become lazy about passing it on, these days I spend most of my time piecing information together from the answers to questions others have asked when they got as stuck as I did. I find in hard to find material online which tells me how to code it right.

But then what is right?
